# MCP Consent Middleware Integration - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-26  
**Branch**: `feature/integrate-with-mcp-layer`  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a standalone MCP consent middleware service that integrates with the existing OAuth 2.0 Authorization and Grant Management APIs. The middleware enforces tool-level consent for Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents using Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) and session-to-grant mapping.

## Architecture

```
MCP Agent → MCP Consent Middleware → MCP Server(s)
                ↓
        Authorization API (/oauth-server/par, /authorize, /token)
                ↓
        Grant Management API (/grants-management/Grants)
```

## Implementation Approach

Following the user's requirements:

1. **✅ Consent middleware as separate app** - Created as standalone CDS service following demo-service pattern
2. **✅ Authorization details instead of scopes** - MCP tools represented as `authorization_details` type `mcp`
3. **✅ Grant Management API integration** - Queries grants instead of storing consents locally
4. **✅ Session mechanism** - Maintains session-to-grant mapping with in-memory storage

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. MCP Protocol Support

- **Initialize**: Filters tools based on session's grant authorization_details
- **Tools/List**: Returns only authorized tools for the session
- **Tools/Call**: Validates authorization before forwarding to downstream server
- **Consent Flow**: Returns authorization URL when consent is required

### 2. Session Management

- In-memory session storage with automatic cleanup (24-hour expiry)
- Session-to-grant mapping after successful OAuth flow
- Session ID extraction from headers or auto-generation
- Agent ID and User ID tracking

### 3. Authorization Integration

- **PAR (Pushed Authorization Request)**: Creates authorization requests with MCP `authorization_details`
- **Authorization Flow**: Redirects users to consent screen
- **Token Exchange**: Exchanges authorization code for tokens
- **Grant Attachment**: Links grant_id to session after consent

### 4. Tool Policy Groups

Predefined policy groups for common patterns:

- `file-read`: ReadFile, ListFiles, GetFileInfo (low risk)
- `file-write`: CreateFile, UpdateFile, WriteFile (medium risk)
- `file-delete`: DeleteFile, RemoveFile (high risk)
- `database-read`: QueryDatabase, ListTables (medium risk)
- `database-write`: InsertRecord, UpdateRecord, ExecuteSQL (high risk)
- `api-access`: HttpRequest, ApiCall (medium risk)
- `system-admin`: ConfigureSystem, ManageUsers (high risk)
- `code-execution`: ExecuteCode, RunScript (high risk)

### 5. Grant Management Integration

- Queries Grant Management API to validate tool permissions
- No local consent storage (grants are source of truth)
- Supports grant merge for adding new tools to existing grants
- Real-time validation of grant status

## API Endpoints

### MCP Proxy

- `POST /mcp-proxy/proxy` - Main MCP JSON-RPC endpoint
- `GET /mcp-proxy/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `GET /mcp-proxy/session?sessionId=xxx` - Session info
- `GET /mcp-proxy/health` - Health check
- `POST /mcp-proxy/revoke?sessionId=xxx` - Revoke authorization

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
MCP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000/mcp      # Downstream MCP server
MCP_CLIENT_ID=mcp-agent-client                # OAuth client ID
MCP_CONSENT_CALLBACK_URL=<auto-detected>     # Callback URL
```

## How It Works

### 1. Agent Makes Tool Call

```json
POST /mcp-proxy/proxy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "ReadFile", "arguments": {...} },
  "id": 1
}
```

### 2. Consent Required Response

If not authorized, returns:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32001,
    "message": "Consent required",
    "data": {
      "authorizationUrl": "http://localhost:4004/oauth-server/authorize?...",
      "sessionId": "session_123",
      "toolName": "ReadFile"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

### 3. User Grants Consent

- User visits authorization URL
- Sees consent screen with MCP tools
- Approves or denies access
- Redirected to callback endpoint

### 4. Grant Attached to Session

- Callback exchanges code for token
- Token response includes `grant_id` and `authorization_details`
- Middleware attaches grant to session
- Subsequent tool calls succeed

### 5. Tool Authorization Validated

For each tool call:

1. Get session from session manager
2. Check if session has grant_id
3. Query grant via Grant Management API
4. Validate tool is in authorization_details
5. Forward to downstream if authorized

## Authorization Details Format

MCP tools are represented as:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
  "transport": "sse",
  "tools": {
    "ReadFile": { "essential": true },
    "ListFiles": { "essential": false }
  },
  "riskLevel": "low",
  "category": "mcp-integration",
  "description": "Access to 2 MCP tool(s): ReadFile, ListFiles"
}
```

This format:

- Persists in grants via Grant Management API
- Supports fine-grained tool-level permissions
- Works with existing OAuth 2.0 infrastructure
- Can be queried and revoked through standard grant operations

## Integration Points

### With Authorization Service

- Uses `par` action to create authorization requests
- Uses `token` action to exchange codes
- Supports `grant_management_action=merge` for adding tools
- Includes MCP authorization_details in PAR requests

### With Grant Management Service

- Uses `read(Grants, grant_id)` to query grants
- Validates grant status (must be "active")
- Checks `authorization_details` for tool permissions
- No local storage of consent data

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite covering:

- Session creation, grant attachment, revocation
- Tool policy grouping and filtering
- Authorization detail validation
- Tool permission checking (object and array formats)

Run tests:

```bash
npm test -- test/mcp-consent.test.ts
```

## Build Status

✅ Project builds successfully with no errors in MCP consent middleware files

Pre-existing TypeScript errors in other files remain unchanged:

- `srv/authorization-service/authorization-service.tsx`
- `srv/authorization-service/handler.consent.tsx`
- `srv/grant-management/handler.revoke.tsx`

## Benefits

1. **No Duplicate Storage**: Uses Grant Management API as single source of truth
2. **Standards-Based**: OAuth 2.0, RAR, Grant Management specification
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Follows demo-service implementation style
4. **Session-Aware**: Maintains GrantMcpLayer's session concept
5. **Policy-Ready**: Tool grouping for better UX
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add custom policies and tool groups

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Persistent session storage (database instead of memory)
- [ ] Device flow support for headless agents
- [ ] Tool policy API for dynamic grouping
- [ ] Usage metrics and monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Admin UI for reviewing MCP tool grants
- [ ] Webhook notifications for consent events
- [ ] Support for multiple downstream MCP servers
- [ ] Integration with GrantMcpLayer C# implementation

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Agent sends MCP tool call
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:4004/mcp-proxy/proxy", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "mcp-session-id": "my-session-123",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    jsonrpc: "2.0",
    method: "tools/call",
    params: { name: "ReadFile", arguments: { path: "/data/file.txt" } },
    id: 1,
  }),
});

const result = await response.json();

if (result.error?.code === -32001) {
  // Consent required - direct user to authorization URL
  console.log("Authorize at:", result.error.data.authorizationUrl);
  // User visits URL, grants consent, callback attaches grant to session
}

// Subsequent calls succeed
```
