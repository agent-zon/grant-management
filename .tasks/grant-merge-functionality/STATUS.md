- âœ… Created dedicated branch: `task-grant-merge-functionality-2025-10-02`
- âœ… Set up task folder structure following memory-bank rules
- âœ… Created task definition with comprehensive requirements
- âœ… Researched OAuth 2.0 Grant Management merge action specification
- âœ… Analyzed current authorize endpoint and consent creation flow
- âœ… Enhanced demo client with merge test configuration
- âœ… Implemented merge action handling in authorize endpoint

### Implementation Summary

**Demo Client Enhancements:**

- Enhanced PAR request to support dynamic `grant_management_action`
- Added grant_id parameter for merge operations
- New "Merge Test" button in demo interface

**Authorize Endpoint Updates:**

- Merges existing grant scopes with new requested scopes
- Removes duplicate permissions automatically
- Creates new consent record with merged permissions

**UI Improvements:**
- Shows merge context in consent form
- Displays current permissions that will be preserved
- Clear indication of additional permissions being requested
- Proper visual distinction between existing and new permissions

### Testing Status
- âœ… Server running with merge functionality
- âœ… Demo client updated with merge test option
- âœ… Merge logic implemented and ready for testing
- ðŸ”„ Ready for end-to-end merge flow validation
