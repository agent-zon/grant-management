## 2025-10-25 - Scope-Based Refactoring (PR Feedback)
**Major architectural improvement based on PR review feedback**

### Created Scope Configuration System
- Created `scope-config.tsx` with centralized scope definitions
- Defined three scopes: `analysis`, `deployment`, `entitlements`
- Each scope has: name, displayName, icon, OAuth scope, color, risk, endpoint, authorization_details
- Added helper functions: `parseGrantedScopes()`, `getNextUngrantedScope()`, `getScopeStatus()`
- Scopes can be reordered independently (SCOPE_ORDER array)

### Replaced Step Numbers with Named Scopes
- **Before**: Numeric steps (0, 1, 2, 3) with strict ordering
- **After**: Named scopes (analysis, deployment, entitlements) with flexible ordering
- Removed all step-related logic from handlers
- Updated service definition to use scope parameters instead of step

### Dynamic Scope Detection
- Callback now parses `scope` field from token response
- Automatically detects which scopes are already granted
- UI updates based on actual granted permissions, not assumed sequence
- No more off-by-one errors in step progression

### Flexible UI Navigation
- Users can click any ungranted scope button to request it
- No forced ordering - can request deployment before analysis if desired
- Granted scopes show checkmark and are disabled
- Pending scopes show "Click to request"
- Requesting scope shows animated pulse

### New Generic Endpoint
- Created `/demo/request_scope?scope_name=X&grant_id=Y`
- Single endpoint handles all scope requests
- Legacy endpoints (`analysis_request`, etc.) now delegate to it
- Maintains backwards compatibility

### Updated Files
- `demo-service.cds`: Changed parameters from `step: Integer` to `granted_scopes: String, requesting_scope: String`
- `demo-service.tsx`: Refactored navbar to use scope status, updated callback
- `handler.request-scope.tsx`: New generic handler for any scope
- `scope-config.tsx`: New configuration module

### Benefits
- ✅ No more hardcoded step order
- ✅ Scopes can be granted in any order
- ✅ UI reflects actual granted permissions
- ✅ Easy to add new scopes (just add to config)
- ✅ Cleaner code with centralized configuration
- ✅ Fixes off-by-one bug mentioned in PR review
