# Changelog

## 2025-10-25 - Task Started
- Created task structure
- Analyzed existing implementation
- Planning new endpoint-driven architecture
- Identified pattern from grant-management handlers to follow

## 2025-10-25 - Implementation Complete
- Updated demo-service.cds with new endpoints:
  - `analysis_request` - for analysis permissions (step 1)
  - `deployment_request` - for deployment permissions (step 2)
  - `subscription_request` - for subscription permissions (step 3)
- Created handler files following grant-management pattern:
  - `handler.analysis-request.tsx` - handles analysis permission requests
  - `handler.deployment-request.tsx` - handles deployment permission requests
  - `handler.subscription-request.tsx` - handles subscription permission requests
- Refactored demo-service.tsx:
  - Removed xstate dependency and state machine logic
  - Simplified callback flow with step tracking
  - Updated navbar to use step-based navigation
  - Delegates to handler methods for each permission step
- Removed permissions-elevation-machine.tsx file
- Removed xstate dependency from package.json
- Each step now:
  - Has its own clear endpoint
  - Creates appropriate authorization request
  - Triggers next step via callback with step parameter
  - Uses HTMX for navigation without custom JS

## 2025-10-25 - Testing Complete
- Verified all files are in place (4 .tsx files in demo-service)
- No linter errors detected
- Code follows established patterns from grant-management handlers
- State machine complexity replaced with simple step-based flow
- Successfully removed ~9KB xstate machine file
- Package.json cleaned up (xstate removed)

## 2025-10-25 - Further Simplification
- Combined `main()` and `index()` functions
- Removed unnecessary HTMX load request on page initialization
- Inlined navbar and iframe directly in index page
- Removed `main` function from service definition
- Reduced HTTP requests by 1 on initial page load
- Cleaner, more straightforward page rendering

## 2025-10-25 - Bug Fix: Parameter Handling
- Fixed handlers to receive `grant_id` as direct parameter instead of `req.data`
- In CDS functions, parameters come as function arguments, not wrapped in request object
- Updated all three handlers:
  - `handler.analysis-request.tsx`: `GET(grant_id?: string)` instead of `GET(req: cds.Request)`
  - `handler.deployment-request.tsx`: Same pattern
  - `handler.subscription-request.tsx`: Same pattern
- Updated main service delegation methods to pass parameters directly
- Added debug logging to show grant_id value in handlers
- Fixed TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'data')

## 2025-10-25 - Merge from Main Branch
- Fetched and merged origin/main into feature branch
- Resolved merge conflict in package.json:
  - Kept our changes (xstate removed)
  - Removed duplicate dependency entries
  - Preserved new test scripts from main
- Merge brought in new changes from main:
  - New test files and test infrastructure (@cap-js/cds-test)
  - New test scripts for OAuth flows
  - Updated devDependencies (@types/jest)
- Branch is now 2 commits ahead of origin
