# PR Response: Scope-Based Architecture Implementation

## Summary

I've refactored the demo service to use named scopes instead of step numbers, addressing the PR feedback and fixing the off-by-one bug. The new architecture is flexible, extensible, and allows users to request permissions in any order.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Centralized Scope Configuration (`scope-config.tsx`)

Defined three scopes with complete metadata:
- **analysis** (`analytics_read`) - Low risk 📊
- **deployment** (`deployments`) - Medium risk 🚀  
- **entitlements** (`billing_read`) - High risk 💳

Each scope includes: name, displayName, icon, OAuth scope, color theme, risk level, endpoint, and authorization_details.

### 2. Replaced Step Numbers with Scope Names

**Before**:
```typescript
/demo/callback?step=1
navbar(grant_id, event, step: Integer)
```

**After**:
```typescript
/demo/callback?requesting_scope=analysis
navbar(grant_id, granted_scopes: String, requesting_scope: String)
```

### 3. Dynamic Scope Detection

The callback now:
- Extracts `scope` field from token response
- Parses it to identify granted scope names
- Passes actual granted scopes to navbar
- No more assumptions about sequence

```typescript
const { scope, grant_id } = tokenResponse;
// scope = "analytics_read deployments" from OAuth server
const grantedScopes = parseGrantedScopes(scope); 
// → Set { "analysis", "deployment" }
```

### 4. Flexible UI Navigation

The navbar now:
- Shows scope status dynamically (granted ✓ / requesting ⏳ / pending 📝)
- Enables ALL ungranted scopes for clicking
- Disables granted scopes
- No forced ordering - users choose their path

### 5. New Generic Endpoint

Created `/demo/request_scope?scope_name=X&grant_id=Y`:
- Single endpoint handles all scopes
- Looks up configuration from `SCOPE_CONFIGS`
- Builds PAR request dynamically
- Legacy endpoints delegate to it

## Fixes

### ✅ Off-by-One Bug Fixed

**Before**: 
```
Step 0 → Complete → Callback increments to step 1 → Event with step 2
→ Navbar enables both deployment AND subscription
```

**After**:
```
No scope → Complete → Callback detects scope="analytics_read"
→ Navbar shows: ✓ Analysis, Click Deployment, Click Entitlements
```

Only granted scopes are marked complete. Pending scopes remain clickable.

### ✅ Flexible Ordering

Users can now:
- Request deployment before analysis
- Skip steps entirely
- Return to grant more permissions later
- See accurate state at all times

The `SCOPE_ORDER` array can be reordered without breaking code.

## Benefits

1. **No Forced Sequence**: Users control the order
2. **Accurate State**: UI reflects actual OAuth grants
3. **Extensible**: Add new scopes in config file only
4. **Type Safe**: TypeScript interfaces enforce structure
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Legacy endpoints still work

## Files Changed

- `demo-service.cds` - Updated function signatures (already committed)
- `demo-service.tsx` - Refactored navbar and callback logic
- `scope-config.tsx` - New configuration module (already committed)
- `handler.request-scope.tsx` - New generic handler

## Testing

✅ No linter errors  
✅ All scopes can be requested independently  
✅ Navbar updates based on granted scopes  
✅ Legacy endpoints work  
✅ Backwards compatible

## Example Usage

### Requesting Analysis
```
GET /demo/request_scope?scope_name=analysis
→ Creates grant with analytics_read scope
→ User approves
→ Callback detects granted_scopes="analytics_read"
→ Navbar shows ✓ Analysis
```

### Requesting Deployment (in any order)
```
GET /demo/request_scope?scope_name=deployment&grant_id=abc123
→ Updates grant with deployments scope
→ User approves
→ Callback detects granted_scopes="analytics_read deployments"
→ Navbar shows ✓ Analysis, ✓ Deployment
```

### Adding New Scope

Just add to `SCOPE_CONFIGS` and `SCOPE_ORDER`:
```typescript
monitoring: {
  name: "monitoring",
  displayName: "Monitoring",
  icon: "📈",
  scope: "monitoring_read",
  ...
}
```

No other code changes needed!
