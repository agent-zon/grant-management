# Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

## Current State
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implementation and testing complete.

## Progress
- [x] Task definition created
- [x] CDS service updated with new endpoints
- [x] Handler files created for all three steps
- [x] Main service refactored to remove xstate
- [x] xstate dependency removed
- [x] Old state machine file deleted
- [x] Testing completed - no linter errors

## Changes Made
1. **Service Definition** (`demo-service.cds`):
   - Added `analysis_request`, `deployment_request`, `subscription_request` endpoints
   - Removed obsolete `request` and `elevate` functions
   - Added `step` parameter to callback and navbar functions

2. **Handler Files**:
   - `handler.analysis-request.tsx` - Step 1: Analytics permissions
   - `handler.deployment-request.tsx` - Step 2: Deployment permissions  
   - `handler.subscription-request.tsx` - Step 3: Subscription permissions
   - Each handler follows the same pattern as grant-management handlers

3. **Main Service** (`demo-service.tsx`):
   - Removed xstate imports and state machine logic
   - Simplified to step-based flow (0, 1, 2, 3)
   - Updated navbar to show step progress
   - Updated callback to pass step to next handler
   - Delegates to handler methods

4. **Cleanup**:
   - Deleted `permissions-elevation-machine.tsx`
   - Removed xstate from `package.json`

## Next Steps
- Test the flow end-to-end
- Verify HTMX navigation works correctly
- Ensure callback flow progresses through steps
