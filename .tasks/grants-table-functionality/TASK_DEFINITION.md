# Task Definition: Grants Table Functionality

## Task Goals
Make the grants table functional by implementing a comprehensive data collection mechanism that captures data from all consent and usage sources.

## Requirements
1. **Research Phase**:
   - Understand current grants table structure and purpose
   - Identify all sources of consent and usage data
   - Understand grantid lifecycle (creation during authorization, storage in request table)
   - Research CDS best practices for consent/usage data management

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Design approach for when to create rows in grants table
   - Implement data collection mechanism from all identified sources
   - Ensure proper integration with existing authorization flow
   - Maintain data integrity and consistency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All consent and usage data sources are identified and documented
- [ ] Clear understanding of when grants table rows should be created
- [ ] Functional grants table that collects data from all relevant sources
- [ ] Integration with existing grantid creation during authorization
- [ ] Proper data flow from request table to grants table
- [ ] Documentation of the implemented approach

## Context
- Current grants table appears to contain mostly aggregations
- Grantid is created during authorization and saved in request table
- Need to determine the best approach for row creation timing
- Must ensure comprehensive data collection from all consent/usage sources

## Success Metrics
- Grants table successfully captures all relevant consent/usage data
- Clear data lineage from authorization through request table to grants table
- Maintainable and scalable solution following CDS best practices

## Timeline
- Research Phase: Initial investigation and documentation
- Implementation Phase: Development and testing of solution
- Validation Phase: Ensure all requirements are met
