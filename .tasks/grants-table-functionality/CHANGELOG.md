# Changelog: Grants Table Functionality Task

## 2025-10-02 - Task Initialization

### Added
- Created branch `task-grants-table-functionality-2025-10-02`
- Established task folder structure in `.task/grants-table-functionality/`
- Created TASK_DEFINITION.md with comprehensive requirements and acceptance criteria
- Created STATUS.md for progress tracking
- Created CHANGELOG.md for chronological documentation
- Created NOTES.md for investigation findings
- Set up TODO tracking system with 7 main tasks

### Context
- User requested implementation of grants table functionality
- Current grants table appears to contain mostly aggregations
- Grantid is created during authorization and saved in request table
- Need to research best approach for comprehensive data collection

### Next Actions
- Begin research phase by examining current codebase structure
- Analyze grants table current implementation
- Map consent and usage data sources
- Understand authorization flow and grantid lifecycle

## 2025-10-02 - Research Phase Complete

### Research Findings
- Identified critical gap: Grants table had no population logic
- Mapped complete authorization flow: PAR → Authorize → Consent → Token
- Found grantid creation: `gnt_${ulid()}` in AuthorizationRequests
- Discovered existing event handlers in grants service returning empty data

### Key Insights
- Grants table designed as aggregation/summary table
- Consents table contains user consent decisions
- GrantUsage table exists but not populated
- UI already implemented but showing empty data due to missing population logic

## 2025-10-02 - Implementation Phase Complete

### Schema Enhancements
- Enhanced Grants entity with comprehensive fields
- Added proper status enum, timing fields, risk levels
- Added calculated fields for usage_count and total_consents
- Improved associations to related entities

### Event Handler Implementation
- Added `after("CREATE", Consents)` handler in AuthorizeService
- Implemented Grant creation/update logic when consent is granted
- Added `after("token")` handler for usage count updates
- Created usage tracking middleware for real-time usage monitoring

### Data Population Logic
- Grants table now populated from Consents and AuthorizationRequests
- GrantUsage records created on actual API usage
- Proper aggregation of consent and usage data
- Maintains audit trail with managed aspects

### Testing Setup
- Added sample data for all entities
- Started development server with `cds watch`
- Ready for functional testing
