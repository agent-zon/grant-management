# Status: Grants Table Functionality Task

## Current Status: ✅ TASK COMPLETE - FUNCTIONAL

### Completed
- ✅ Created dedicated branch: `task-grants-table-functionality-2025-10-02`
- ✅ Set up task folder structure following memory-bank rules
- ✅ Created task definition and initial documentation
- ✅ Researched current grants table structure and identified critical gaps
- ✅ Identified all consent and usage data sources
- ✅ Understood grantid lifecycle and authorization flow
- ✅ Researched CDS best practices for data aggregation
- ✅ Designed comprehensive approach for grants table population
- ✅ Enhanced Grants entity schema with proper fields and relationships
- ✅ Implemented event handlers for consent-to-grant creation
- ✅ Implemented usage tracking middleware
- ✅ Added sample data for testing
- ✅ Started development server for testing

### Implementation Summary
**Enhanced Grants Table Schema:**
- Added comprehensive fields: client_id, scope, status, timing info, risk_level
- Added calculated fields: usage_count, total_consents
- Added proper associations to Consents, GrantUsage, RiskAnalysis

**Event Handlers Implemented:**
- `after("CREATE", Consents)`: Creates/updates Grants table rows when consent is granted
- `after("token")`: Updates usage count when tokens are issued
- Usage tracking middleware: Tracks actual API usage with GrantUsage records

**Data Flow Established:**
1. AuthorizationRequests created with grantid (`gnt_${ulid()}`)
2. User grants consent → Consents record created
3. Event handler creates/updates Grants table row with aggregated data
4. Token usage tracked via middleware → GrantUsage records created
5. Grants table serves as comprehensive summary/aggregation table

### Final Implementation
**Simplified Approach (Following User Feedback):**
- Created Grants as a calculated view over Consents with GROUP BY grant
- Shows latest consent record per grant with related request properties
- Updated UI components to match actual data model properties
- Added "View Details" links from list to individual grant pages

### Testing Results
- ✅ Server starts successfully on http://localhost:4004
- ✅ Grants endpoint responds: `/grants-management/Grants`
- ✅ HTML UI renders correctly with updated property mappings
- ✅ Authentication working with mock users
- ✅ Data structure matches between schema and UI components

### Key Success Factors
1. **Simplified Schema**: Used calculated view instead of complex event handlers
2. **Proper Grouping**: GROUP BY grant ensures one row per grant
3. **UI Alignment**: Updated React components to match actual data properties
4. **Working Links**: Added navigation from list to detail views

### Endpoints Available
- **List View**: `GET /grants-management/Grants` (HTML/JSON)
- **Detail View**: `GET /grants-management/Grants/{grantId}` (HTML/JSON)
- **Authentication**: Mock users (alice, bob, etc.)
